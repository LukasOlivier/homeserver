## üö® RAID Alert Setup

1. **Create the alert script**:
   ```bash
   sudo nano /usr/local/bin/raid_alert.sh
   ```

2. **Add the following content:**
    ```bash
    #!/bin/bash

    # Discord webhook URL
    WEBHOOK_URL="https://discord.com/api/webhooks/YOUR_WEBHOOK_URL"

    # Message content
    MESSAGE="üö® **RAID Alert**: A drive has failed in your RAID array on $(hostname)! Check immediately. üö®"

    # Send the message
    curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST -d "{\"content\": \"$MESSAGE\"}" $WEBHOOK_URL
    ```
       
3. **Save and exit. Make the script executable:**
    ```bash
    sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/raid_alert.sh
    ```

4. **Update the RAID monitoring configuration:**
    ```bash
    sudo nano /etc/mdadm/mdadm.conf
    ```

5. **Add the following line:**
    ```bash
    PROGRAM /usr/local/bin/raid_alert.sh
    ```

6. **Restart the RAID monitoring service:**
    ```bash
    sudo systemctl restart mdmonitor
    ```
